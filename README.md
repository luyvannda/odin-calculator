Project: Calculator v0.99

Developer: Luy Vannda

This is the final project to get through the odin project's foundation course in web development. The project has been polished. However, I wouldn't consider it a 100% completion hence the v0.99. With my limited skills I have make the calculator as seamless as possible. However, there is still known bugs in negate button, in the future as my developer skill is improved I will visit it again and iron out all bugs if possible.

Special thanks to Dors Coding School for video tutorial on how to build a simple calculator. This project is inspired from the video but not exactly the same. The calculator I built is more complex.
